# Next Steps
Below are a list of potential next steps

## Cloud Operations Discovery
If this session was a good use of time, we should spend time with Infrastructure
to learn more about the operational model for these applications. We can bring
in a Platform Architect to lead this session. This is a 4 hour to 1 day 
time commitment.

## Cloud Native Java Workshop
If you are interested in more detail around CND Java best practices, 
we can deliver a hands-on workshop that uses working code to explain
microservices patterns and deployment techniques. 
This is a 1 day time commitment. 


## Cloud Native .NET Workshop
If you are interested in more detail around CND .NET best practices, 
we can deliver a hands-on workshop that uses working code to explain
microservices patterns and deployment techniques. 
This is a 1 day time commitment.
