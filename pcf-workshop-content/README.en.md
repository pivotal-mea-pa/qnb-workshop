COURSE OVERVIEW
===============

This course provides students with the concepts and experience needed to
work with and deploy applications on Pivotal Cloud Foundry. Students
will gain experience in pushing apps to Cloud Foundry, accessing logs,
and scaling. Students will explore topics directly related to the design
and running of cloud native applications, including micro-service
architectures, blue-green deployments, and continuous delivery.

COURSE DURATION
===============

Instructor-led: 1 day

TARGET AUDIENCE
===============

Application developers & architects seeking introductory understanding
of Cloud Foundry and experience using it to deploy, manage, and scale
applications.

PREREQUISITES
=============

Understanding of application development and deployment. This course is
aimed at developers regardless of your development language of choice.
No specific programming language is needed or assumed. The Boeing
environment favors Java or .Net. The hands on Labs will primarily be
based on languages that target the Java or .Net core runtime.

COURSE OBJECTIVES
=================

At the end of the training, participants should have an understanding of
the following:

-   Understand the differences between traditional IT provisioning,
    Infrastructure as a Service and Platform as a Service

-   Explain organizations, spaces, routes, services (managed, user-
    defined), manifests, build packs, applications and droplets

-   Identify Pivotal Cloud Foundry components: Router, Cloud Controller,
    Health Manager, Loggregator and Cells

-   Deploy pre-existing applications to Pivotal Cloud Foundry, obtain
    logs, debug deployment issues, scale, start, stop, bind to services

-   Use the command-line interface and Apps Manager to work with Pivotal
    Cloud Foundry

-   Understand the impact of the cloud environment on application
    architecture

-   Perform zero-downtime deployments

-   Understand the role of services in Pivotal Cloud Foundry, gain
    experience using one or more examples

-   Understand the purpose of build packs, gain experience specifying
    build packs and making configuration changes
