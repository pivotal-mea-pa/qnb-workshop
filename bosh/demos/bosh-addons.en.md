## Goal

Adding specific software agents, monitors, and policies to specific BOSH dmakes day 2 operations easy! Lets upgrade our zookeeper cluster to the latest version.

## Prerequisites

1. Completed [Real Life - Deploy Zookeeper Demo](./deploy-zookeeper)

## Ensure our zookeeper is deployed:

1. Utilize your SSH Client to connect to your jumpbox.

  - `ssh username@jumpbox-ip`

1. Utilize the BOSH CLI to check the status of the deployment.

  - `bosh -e my-bosh -d zookeeper instances -p`

  - You should see something similar to the following:

            Using environment '10.0.0.6' as user 'admin' (openid, bosh.admin)

            Task 41. Done

            Deployment 'zookeeper'

            11 instances

            Succeeded

## Upload the OS-Conf BOSH Release

1. Utilize the BOSH CLI to upload the latest os-conf release that we can use to add an SSH banner to our BOSH zookeeper instances.

  - `bosh -e my-bosh upload-release https://bosh.io/d/github.com/cloudfoundry/os-conf-release?v=19 --sha1 f515406949ee0bba0329d1ce4a7eb1679521eabd`

## Create a BOSH Runtime Config

1. BOSH has a way to specify global configuration for all VMs in all deployments, it is called the Runtime-Config.
1. To update our zookeeper deployment from [Deploy BOSH Release]({{< relref "Deploy-BOSH-Release.md" >}}) by adding an SSH banner, we first have to create a runtime-config.

  - `nano runtime-config.yml`

1. Copy the following into the `runtime-config.yml` file we just created.

        releases:
        - name: os-conf
          version: 19

        addons:
        - name: misc
          jobs:
          - name: login_banner
            release: os-conf
          properties:
            login_banner:

                port-scan, deface, hack, or otherwise interfere with any services on this system
                will be reported.

## Upload the BOSH Runtime Config

1. Now lets use the BOSH CLI to upload the `runtime-config.yml`.

  - `bosh -e my-bosh update-runtime-config runtime-config.yml`

## Apply the BOSH Runtime Config

1. BOSH only applies runtime-config changes to the deployment during a `bosh deploy`. We must redeploy the zookeeper deployment as a last step to get our SSH banner.

  - `bosh -e my-bosh -d zookeeper deploy ~/zookeeper-manifest.yml`

## Test the SSH Banner

1. To test the SSH Banner lets SSH to a BOSH instance. Review [Releases]({{< relref "Releases.md" >}}) for understanding access to BOSH instances.

  - `bosh -e my-bosh -d zookeeper instances`
  - `bosh -e my-bosh -d zookeeper ssh zookeeper/185f9261-e51f-46b5-87f4-38e3e56f61a9`

  - You should see something similar to the following:

            Using environment '10.0.0.6' as user 'admin' (openid, bosh.admin)

            Using deployment 'zookeeper'
