## Goal

BOSH Errands enable on demand execution of tasks within the deployment. This could be checking the status on a resource, adding a new user, running tests, or even `cf push`ing an application! Let's see an errand in action!

## Prerequisites

1. Completed [Real Life - Deploy Zookeeper Demo](./deploy-zookeeper)

## Ensure our zookeeper is deployed:

1. Utilize your SSH Client to connect to your jumpbox.

  - `ssh username@jumpbox-ip`

1. Utilize the BOSH CLI to check the status of the deployment.

  - `bosh -e my-bosh -d zookeeper instances -p`

  - You should see something similar to the following:

            Using environment '10.0.0.6' as user 'admin' (openid, bosh.admin)

            Task 41. Done

            Deployment 'zookeeper'

            Instance                                          Process    Process State  AZ  IPs

            ~                                                 zookeeper  running        -   -

            ~                                                 zookeeper  running        -   -

            11 instances

            Succeeded

## List possible Errands to run in the deployment:

1. Utilize the BOSH CLI to check the possible errands we could run on this deployment.

  - `bosh -e my-bosh -d zookeeper errands`

  - You should see something similar to the following:

            Using environment '10.0.0.6' as user 'admin' (openid, bosh.admin)

            Using deployment 'zookeeper'

            Name
            smoke-tests

            1 errands

            Succeeded

## Run a BOSH Errand:

1. While the BOSH CLI can tell us if the deployment is running successful it is important to have a smoke-test which can use a dedicated new instance to perform some sort of tests, probably upon the running cluster. Lets run it with the BOSH CLI.

  - `bosh -e my-bosh -d zookeeper run-errand smoke-tests`

  - You should see something similar to the following:

            Using environment '10.0.0.6' as user 'admin' (openid, bosh.admin)

            Using deployment 'zookeeper'

## Examine the Output:

1. The log output shown from the errand should look similar to the following:
