## Goal

In order for BOSH to communicate with specific infrastructures (GCP/AWS/vSphere/etc.) we abstract these details into a BOSH cloud-config. Lets create and upload our own to the BOSH director.

## Prerequisites

1. Obtain your workshop jumpbox public IP, Username, and Password 
1. Obtain your GCP Network Name 

## Part 1: Creating the Cloud Config

1. Utilize your SSH Client to connect to your jumpbox.

  - `ssh username@jumpbox-ip`

1. Utilize your favorite command-line text editor to create a `cloud-config.yml` text file. (We will use `nano`, but `vi` works as well!)

  - `nano cloud-config.yml`

1. Paste the following into the `cloud-config.yml`.

````yaml
azs:
- name: z1
  cloud_properties: {zone: us-central1-a}
- name: z2
  cloud_properties: {zone: us-central1-f}

vm_types:
- name: default
  cloud_properties:
    machine_type: n1-standard-1
    root_disk_size_gb: 20
    root_disk_type: pd-ssd
- name: large
  cloud_properties:
    machine_type: n1-standard-2
    root_disk_size_gb: 20
    root_disk_type: pd-ssd
disk_types:
- name: default
  disk_size: 3000

networks:
- name: default
  type: manual
  subnets:
  - range:   10.0.0.0/16
    gateway: 10.0.0.1
    dns:     [8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4]
    reserved: [10.0.0.0-10.0.0.10]
    azs:     [z1, z2]
    cloud_properties:
      ephemeral_external_ip: true
      subnetwork_name: <YOUR_GCP-SUBNET-NAME>
      network_name: <YOUR-GCP-NETWORK-NAME>
      ephemeral_external_ip: true
      tags: [bosh]
- name: vip
  type: vip

compilation:
  workers: 3
  reuse_compilation_vms: true
  az: z1
  vm_type: default
  network: default
````

1. Change the value of the `subnetwork_name: <YOUR_GCP-SUBNET-NAME>` and `network_name: <YOUR-GCP-NETWORK-NAME>` tags to your GCP subnet and GCP network name provided earlier 

## Part 2: Understanding the Cloud Config

When deploying services we have to define the following:

  1. `azs` or availability zones allow us to provide high availability to our services deployed with BOSH. Here we create 2 zones, z1, and z2.

  1. `vm_types` allow us to t-shirt size the vms that make up our services deployed with BOSH. Here we create a default vm_type that contains a Standard machine with 4 virtual CPUs, 15 GB of memory, and a 20GB SSD disk.

  1. `disk_types` describe what type disks can be attached as a persistent disk to the vms that make up our services deployed with BOSH. In this case we create a 3GB disk.

  1. `networks` define what ips, gateways, dns, and specific cloud provider networking properties are needed. Here we will use the `10.0.0.0 - 10.0.255.255` subnet with google dns `8.8.8.8`, and the GCP network that you replaced.

  1. `compilation` specifies which of all the above resources BOSH should use when compiling code.

## Part 3: Uploading the Cloud Config to the BOSH director

1. Upload the `cloud-config.yml` to the BOSH director. All services we deploy with BOSH will use this from now on.

  - `bosh -e my-bosh update-cloud-config cloud-config.yml`
