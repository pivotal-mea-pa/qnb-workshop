## Goal

BOSH makes day 2 operations easy! Lets upgrade our zookeeper cluster to the latest version.

## Prerequisites

1. Completed [Deploy Zookeeper Demo](./deploy-zookeeper)

## Ensure our zookeeper is deployed:

1. Utilize your SSH Client to connect to your jumpbox.

  - `ssh username@jumpbox-ip`

1. Utilize the BOSH CLI to check the status of the deployment.

  - `bosh -e my-bosh -d zookeeper instances -p`

  - You should see something similar to the following:

            Using environment '10.0.0.6' as user 'admin' (openid, bosh.admin)

            Task 41. Done

            Deployment 'zookeeper'

            11 instances

            Succeeded

## Upload the latest zookeeper BOSH Release

1. Utilize the BOSH CLI to upload the latest zookeeper release.

  - `bosh -e my-bosh upload-release https://bosh.io/d/github.com/cppforlife/zookeeper-release?v=0.0.7 --sha1 a863ef216ea75d22950703a3c924959cb20e59ba`

1. Ensure the release was uploaded and is ready for use!

  - `bosh -e my-bosh releases`

  - You should see something similar to the following:

            Using environment '10.0.0.6' as user 'admin' (openid, bosh.admin)

            Name                 Version   Commit Hash
            my-bosh              0+dev.1   empty+
            sample-bosh-release  0+dev.1   a2b19b8
            zookeeper            0.0.7     e7ead22
            ~                    0.0.6     2f8926f

            (*) Currently deployed
            (+) Uncommitted changes

            2 releases

            Succeeded

## Update our zookeeper deployment

1. To update our zookeeper deployment from [Deploy BOSH Release]("./deploy-bosh-release") utilize the BOSH CLI to Redeploy.

  - `bosh -e my-bosh -d zookeeper deploy ~/zookeeper-manifest.yml`

  - Notice that we did not change any values in the `zookeeper-manifest.yml`! This is because we specified `latest` under the releases block in the `zookeeper-manifest.yml`.
