## Goal

There are many tools that attempt to concur automating infrastructure, but BOSH was designed not only with this in mind but also what we call "day 2 operations". Lets take a quick look at how easy it is to expand a BOSH instance.

## Expand the BOSH Instance Size:


1. Utilize the BOSH CLI to show how much

  - `bosh -e vbox-d sample-bosh-deployment instances --vitals`

1. SSH into the BOSH instance in our `sample-bosh-deployment`.

  - `bosh -e vbox -d sample-bosh-deployment ssh sample_vm/3f361ef3-7a9d-4e7d-a167-9bf5ad033c02`

1. Check the number of CPU cores via the `nproc` utility. Note this down.

  - `nproc --all`

1. Check the memory capacity via the `free` utility. Note this down.

  - `free -g`

1. Exit the BOSH instance.

  - `exit`

1. Edit the `sample-bosh-manifest.yml` text file on your jumpbox. (We will use `nano`, but `vi` works as well!)

  - `nano sample-bosh-manifest.yml`

1. Change the `vm_type: default` line to `vm_type: large`. This will upgrade the t-shirt sizing for the BOSH instance.

1. Save the file.

1. Have BOSH apply the changes to the deployment.

  - `bosh -e vbox -d sample-bosh-deployment deploy sample-bosh-manifest.yml`

  - Notice BOSH always will show the difference between what is currently deployed and what you are asking to be changed:

            Using environment '10.0.0.6' as user 'admin' (openid, bosh.admin)

            Using deployment 'sample-bosh-deployment'

              instance_groups:
              - name: sample_vm
            -   vm_type: default
            +   vm_type: large

1. SSH back into the BOSH instance in our `sample-bosh-deployment`.

1. Check the number of CPU cores via the `nproc` utility. This should be larger than before!

  - `nproc --all`

1. Check the memory capacity via the `free` utility. This should be larger than before!

  - `free -g`

1. Exit the BOSH instance.

  - `exit`

1. Once back on the jumpbox use the BOSH CLI to show the overall vitals for the BOSH instance. This is handy when determining if instances are overloaded.

  - `bosh -e vbox -d sample-bosh-deployment instances --vitals`

              Using environment '10.0.0.6' as user 'admin' (openid, bosh.admin)

              Task 106. Done
