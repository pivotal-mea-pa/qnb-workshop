JetBrains provides an IDE for .NET Core development called Rider. It can be downloaded [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/download/).

Even if you're not familiar with the syntax highlighting of Visual Studio, I recommend using the Dark Visual Studio theme (with minor alterations), as it is a lot easier on the eyes for prolonged periods of time. You can find my version [here](../JetBrains-Rider/VisualStudioDark-Custom.icls).
