# IDEs

**Previous:** [SDK for .NET Core and dotnet CLI](../sdk-for-.net-core-and-dotnet-cli)

There are a number of useful IDEs out there for working with .NET Core:

**JetBrains Rider**

You can download Rider [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/download/).

Even if you're not familiar with the syntax highlighting of Visual Studio, I recommend using the Dark Visual Studio theme (with minor alterations), as it is a lot easier on the eyes for prolonged periods of time. You can find my version [here](VisualStudioDark-Custom.icls)).

**Microsoft Visual Studio**

Microsoft provides a free version of Visual Studio 2017 (Community) for .NET Core development. It can be downloaded [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).

**Microsoft Visual Studio Code**

An alternative to the two above IDEs, with much more of a plug-in/extension based implementation of language support, Microsoft provides Visual Studio Code for free [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/). If you plan on using this tool, you should install the [Microsoft's C# plug-in for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.csharp). It can be found by searching for `C#` in the extensions tab.

**Up Next:** [Deploy Concourse](../deploy-concourse)
