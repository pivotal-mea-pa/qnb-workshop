In this section, we'll describe how to start your first app using [[JetBrains Rider]]. We'll be building a Notes RESTful API where multiple users can add and retrieve notes.

First is `NotesApp â€¢ 1 project`. This is the top-level *solution* that contains one *project*. The solution file is not one that is usually modified manually, but it can be accessed by right-clicking the solution, and going to `Edit > Edit NotesApp.sln` in the **Solution Explorer**.

Next is the `NotesApp` project. A *project* is part of a *solution*. This file may be accessed in a similar fashion to how `NotesApp.sln` is accessed.

In the **Dependencies** section, you'll find **.NETCoreApp 2.2** indicating that we are using .NET Core 2.2 for our project.

The **Packages** section provides a deep-dive into what dependencies we have included in our project. You can also view these by looking at `NotesApp.csproj`.

The `Controllers` directory contains an auto-generated `ValuesController.cs` which we'll be updating/replacing in this tutorial.

The `Properties` directory and the `launchSettings.json` file within are not needed for this guide, and should be deleted.

The `wwwroot` directory is for publishing a static website. It will not be used in this guide, and should be deleted.

The `appsettings.json` file is the default configuration file for the project. `appsettings.Development.json` contains configurations used only in the `Development` environment. You can specify additional configuration files with `appsettings.{environment}.json`.

`Program.cs` contains the Main program, which runs a web server built with our `Startup` class. `Startup.cs` is where we'll define a lot of the setup for our database, our injectable classes, and various Cloud Foundry integrations.
