### Prerequisites for the Pivotal PACE Cloud Operations workshop

**TLDR:**

- Whiteboard or Paperboard
- Unfettered Internet access
- PWS Account
- Running Foundation with PAS installed

Please use a whiteboard to present any or all of this material if that suits your presentation style. This is a 'discovery' workshop and our goal is to create a common baseline of knowledge for our customer to grow from along with learning about their process and challenges.

During this workshop you will need access to a whiteboard or paperboard to document and diagram any of the sections listed in the README where we have a **Whiteboard:** discovery section defined.

Pivotal Web Services may be used for the **Demo/Lab: Push an App** in the **What is PCF** section. If you have your own Foundation setup please by all means use that.

A running Foundation with PAS installed is ideal. The **Demo/Lab: Repave (BOSH Recreate)** in the **Security Posture** section will be easier to complete with this available.
