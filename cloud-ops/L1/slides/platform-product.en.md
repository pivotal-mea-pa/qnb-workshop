**Success is NOT just installation of PCF...that part is easy.**

Design the product (your platform) around the needs of our customers, rather than seeking to change the user's behaviors around how a product (Pivotal Cloud Foundry) works.

Your platform team partners with stakeholders to create a culture of continuous improvement.

**Success is a Platform Product, a Balanced Team, and a Path to Production.**
