**Deployment Defined: Effective Action**

With PCF you can treat your application code and your platform operating code all as deployments. This brings consistency with how teams can program both the applications and platform to begin or fast track integrating Development and Operations. Looking to begin SRE practices or to accelerate SRE adoption, you can do that too with PCF.

**Deploy platform products and application code across clusters, clouds, regions...you choose...all with sophisticated yet simplistic tooling.**
