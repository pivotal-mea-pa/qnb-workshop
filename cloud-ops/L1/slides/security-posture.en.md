**We approach security from the mindset of Security professionals and PCF Users.**

Some ways that Cloud Foundry mitigates against security threats:

- Minimizes network surface area

- Isolates customer applications and data in containers

- Encrypt connections

- Uses role-based access controls, applying and enforcing roles and permissions to ensure that users can only view and affect the spaces for which they have been granted access

- Ensures security of application bits in a multi-tenant environment

- Prevents possible denial of service attacks through resource starvation

**We also enable some unique functionality for your Platform Operators to take security operations to the next level.**
